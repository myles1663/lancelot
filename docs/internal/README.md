# Internal Development Documentation

This directory contains the original specification and blueprint documents used to architect
and generate Lancelot's codebase through Claude Code.

These documents are preserved as:
- Architectural reference for contributors
- Development methodology documentation
- Historical record of design decisions

## Directory Structure

- `specs/` — Detailed technical specifications for each subsystem
- `blueprints/` — Step-by-step implementation blueprints with sequential prompts

## Note

These are internal development artifacts, not user-facing documentation.
For user documentation, see the [docs/](../) directory.
