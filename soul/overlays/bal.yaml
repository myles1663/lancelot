# BAL Soul Overlay — Business Automation Layer Governance
# ===========================================================================
# This overlay is loaded ADDITIVELY on top of the base Soul when
# FEATURE_BAL is enabled.  It CANNOT weaken, remove, or override
# any base Soul rules — it only appends additional governance.
#
# This is the reference implementation for composable Soul overlays.
# Other domain-specific overlays (finance, ops, etc.) follow this pattern.

# Feature flag: FEATURE_BAL
