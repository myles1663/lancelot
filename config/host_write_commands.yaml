# Host Write Commands — DANGEROUS
# These command binaries are allowed ONLY when FEATURE_HOST_WRITE_COMMANDS is ON.
# They execute on the REAL HOST MACHINE via the Host Bridge.
# All write commands still require Commander approval via the Sentry.
#
# One command binary per line. Lines starting with # are comments.
# Catastrophic patterns (rm -rf /, format c:, etc.) are STILL blocked
# by the Host Bridge provider denylist regardless of this list.
